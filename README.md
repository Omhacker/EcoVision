# Smart Waste Management & Automated Segregation System

## Overview
The Smart Waste Management & Automated Segregation System is an advanced IoT and AI-powered solution designed to efficiently monitor, classify, and manage waste. By integrating ESP32, LoRa, GPS, ultrasonic sensors, Raspberry Pi, and machine learning, this system ensures optimal waste classification and real-time tracking. It assists municipal corporations and households in managing waste through timely alerts and automated segregation.

## Features
- ✅ Automated Waste Classification: Uses soil moisture sensors for dry/wet classification and machine learning for organic/recyclable sorting.
- ✅ Bin Fill Level Monitoring: Ultrasonic sensors detect when a bin is 90% full and trigger alerts.
- ✅ Real-Time GPS Tracking: NEO-6M GPS module provides location data for smart bins.
- ✅ Long-Range Communication: LoRa (SX1278) enables data transmission over long distances.
- ✅ Solar-Powered System: Uses solar panels and batteries for sustainable energy.
- ✅ Mobile & Web Dashboard: Sends real-time alerts to municipal authorities and household users.

## System Architecture
The system consists of two main components:

### 1️⃣ Smart Waste Management System (IoT-based)
- ESP32 DevKit V1 (Microcontroller)
- SX1278 LoRa Module (Long-range communication)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (Bin fill level detection)
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor (Dry/Wet waste classification)
- NEO-6M GPS Module (Location tracking)
- Solar Panel (6V, 5W) & 18650 Li-Ion Battery (3.7V, 5000mAh) (Power System)
- TP4056 Charging Module, MT3608 Boost Converter, AMS1117 Voltage Regulator

### 2️⃣ Automated Waste Segregation System (AI & ML-based)
- Arduino Uno R3 & Raspberry Pi 3 (Microcontrollers)
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) (Waste detection)
- Camera Module (USB Webcam) (Image-based classification)
- Servo Motor (SG90) (Sorting mechanism)
- TensorFlow/Keras & Python (Machine learning model for classification)

## How It Works
1. Waste Detection: Ultrasonic sensors detect the presence of waste.
2. Waste Classification:
   - Dry/Wet Classification: Soil moisture sensors analyze moisture content.
   - Organic/Recyclable Sorting: A camera module captures waste images, which are processed by a machine learning model.
3. Sorting Mechanism: A servo motor directs waste to the appropriate bin.
4. Data Processing & Transmission: ESP32 sends data via LoRa to a central monitoring system.
5. GPS Tracking: Bins' locations are updated in real-time.
6. Alert System:
   - If a bin reaches 90% capacity, an alert is sent to municipal authorities.
   - Users receive notifications via the mobile app/web dashboard for timely collection.

## Performance & Accuracy
- 📏 Ultrasonic Sensor Detection Accuracy: 98%
- 🎯 Machine Learning Classification Accuracy: 92%
- ⚡ Sorting Efficiency: High precision with minimal error
